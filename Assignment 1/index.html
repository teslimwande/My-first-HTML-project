        <h2>Briefly About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a young banking banking professional with over 2 years of
          experience in banking operations. I work for one of Nigeria's Top
          banks. I was born in the Mid 90s in Osun State, Nigeria. I attended
          Albert Memorial International Nur. and Primary School in Ede, Osun
          State, between 2001 to 2006. I also attended Oba Laoye Grammar School,
          Ede Osun state, where I earned the SSCE certificate in 2012. In the
          year 2013, I gained admission to the University of Ilorin to study
          Biochemsitry where I went on to bag a Bsc degree in the year 2017. I
          was mobilized to Edo state in the same year (2017) for my one year
          mandatory National youth Service Scheme. Immediately after my youth
          service, I was dedicated to honing my research skills, while also
          applying for scholarships to pursue my post-graduate studies abroad.
          This yielded a positive result in late 2019 as I was a recipient of a
          post-graduate research scholarship grant at the Usman Dan-Fodio
          Univeristy in Sokoto stete, Nigeria. However, I declined this
          opportunity as I was offered a more lucrative offer by a bank within
          the same period. I went through the bank's Graduate training school
          program between January 2020 through April of the same year. However,
          the COVID-19 pandemic delayed my assumption of duty until February,
          2021. I work at the bank till date, serving across different teams
          within branch operations.

        <h2>Why Altschool Africa?</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been a great tech enthusiast, with a keen curiosity
          about the techniques underlying softwares we use on daily bases. To
          that effect, I have embarked on different self-taught adventures to
          learn some of these skills, which gave me background knowledge of some
          of my main curiosities. However, I wasn't consistent enough with these
          learning processes as I usually lose focus along the line. Luckily for
          me, I got to learn about Altschool Africa from a friend who is now an
          alumnus of the school, telling me about the amazing stuff  happening at
          Altschool - how they integrate passion,discipline and expertise into forging world-class engineers - coupled with several testaments I saw online in my further
          fact-finding task about the school made me arrive at the decision that
          Altschool Africa is the right place for me to be!
